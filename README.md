### Howdy

I'm Matt Waite, a professor of practice in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. I teach programming to communicators through data journalism and sports data classes. I also started a drone journalism lab to study how to use flying robots for journalism and to teach students how to do it right. I've been teaching since 2011. Before that, I worked in daily newspapers in Arkansas and Florida, last at the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times), where in 2007 I was the principal developer behind PolitFact.com, which became the first website to win a Pulitzer Prize in 2009. 

I believe passionately in making my materials open and I believe textbook pricing is out of control. So, where I can, I make custom materials for my classes for students and give it to them for free.

* [Sports Data Analysis and Visualization](http://mattwaite.github.io/sports/), a book on using R and the Tidyverse to analyze and visualize sports data. [Repo](https://github.com/mattwaite/sportsdatabook)
* [Data Journalism with R and the Tidyverse](http://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalism/), a book on how to do analytic journalism using R and public data. [Repo](https://github.com/mattwaite/datajournalismbook)
* [Getting Started with Drone Journalism](http://mattwaite.github.io/dronebook/), a book on how to pass the FAA's knowledge exam and start using drones for journalism.

I also helped start the [Roper Lab for Data in Community News](https://roperdatalab.github.io/), using data journalism to create locally relevant data-driven content for small news organizations in Nebraska. And I'm interested in [using sensors](https://sensoringjournalism.github.io/) to gather [data for storytelling](https://github.com/SensoringJournalism).
