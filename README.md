### Howdy

I'm Matt Waite, a professor of practice in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I teach programming to communicators through data journalism and sports data classes. I also started a drone journalism lab to study how to use flying robots for journalism and to teach students how to do it right. I've been teaching since 2011. Before that, I worked in daily newspapers in Arkansas and Florida, last at the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times), where in 2007 I was the principal developer behind PolitFact.com, which became the first website to win a Pulitzer Prize in 2009. 

I believe passionately in making my materials open and I believe textbook pricing is out of control. So, where I can, I make custom materials for my classes for students and give it all away for free.

#### Current materials

* [Sports Data Analysis and Visualization Tutorials](https://github.com/mattwaite/SportsDataTutorials), a set of interactive tutorials in how to use the Tidyverse to analyze and visualize sports data. Uses LearnR to display the tutorials.
* [Data Journalism with R and the Tidyverse Tutorials](http://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalism/), a set of LearnR tutorials on how to do analytic journalism using R and public data. **Soon to be replaced**. 
* **In Progress**: [The Art of Data Journalism](https://the-art-of-data-journalism.github.io/): An R-based data journalism class in a box. A series of LearnR tutorials that takes students from the basics of rows and columns to publication-ready graphics using *local* data for them. Once a location is set, the tutorials use data, geography and examples from that place to make it relevant to where students live. **Official launch in January 2025**. 
* [Getting Started with Drone Journalism](http://mattwaite.github.io/dronebook/), a Quarto-based book on how to pass the FAA's knowledge exam and start using drones for journalism.
* [Advanced Sports Data Analysis](https://mattwaite.github.io/advancedsports/), an in-progress Quarto-based book on using R, the Tidyverse and Tidymodels to bring machine learning into predicting outcomes in sports.

My employer uses me in [ads for the university](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOEulworQ5E). And [recuiting materials](https://cocreate.unl.edu/article/matt-waite). And [alumni relations](https://www.huskeralum.org/s/1620/magazine/interior.aspx?sid=1620&gid=1&pgid=3124). My kids hate it.
